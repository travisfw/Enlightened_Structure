This is the sourcecode that generates [enlightenedstructure.REPLACEME.com][]. To make your own
version:

* Visit [github.com/REPLACEME/Enlightened_Structure][]
* Log into / create account on Github if necessary
* Press the "Fork" button
* Edit or add pages as desired
* The resulting generated site will be available at your-github-username.github.com/Enlightened_Structure
* If you want a custom domain, you can use (e.g.) _enlightenedstructure.your-domain.com_ by setting
  a CNAME record for this subdomain to _your-github-username.github.com_.  For detailed
  instructions, see [Github Pages].
* Pull requests -- in which your changes can be merged back into the parent site which you forked --
  are encouraged.
* To avoid problems retaining your own link urls when merging in changes from others, it is
  suggested that you maintain two branches: one called "master" that retains the generic links (eg
  github.com/REPLACEME/Enlightened_Structure), and one called "gh-pages" with your own customized
  links. Others can then merge changes from your "master" branch without concern of it overwriting
  their customized links. (If this is gibberish to you, don't sweat it.)
