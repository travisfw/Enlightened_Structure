Node Basics
-----------

 * The basic node visualization is a hexagonal portal, a _window_ into to the content of the node
 * Nodes are color coded on the vertexes: pinpricks of brilliant colors, laser sharp like starlight:

             Violet     Red
                    ---
             Blue /     \  Orange
                  \     /
             Green  --- Yellow

 * Everything is a node
 * Some of the more interesting nodes are people, communities, planets
 * Each color encodes an area of the system -- community, communications, etc
 * Easy to see systems that are in balance, or out of balance, by the brightness of the harmonic intersection.
 * Healing tool: balancing energies starts with seeing the current configuration.
 * The strength of your harmonics determine what nodes show up, but the brightness of the harmonic is determined both by your harmonic and the harmonic strength of the connected nodes.

Node Layouts
------------

Node layouts are views, visual representations of the node network. For example:

 * Harmonic -- Central focal node surrounded by related nodes, clustering around colors / categories
 * Similarity -- Nodes cluster by similarity across multiple axes
 * Trust -- Radial sorting of nodes based on the trust, as illuminated by your cascading trust cones

Node Filters
------------

Node filters allow you to narrow the selection of nodes that is displayed, or change the ordering or proximity of the nodes. Node filters do not define a view, but affect what is being shown in the active view. Examples of filters would include:

 * Trust -- Trusted nodes filter to the top so you can see the ones you care about, your trust cone
 * Popularity -- Node popularity (traffic, votes, etc) determines visibility level
 * Harmonic
 * Similarity

UI
--

* Node filters are easily added, removed, and adjusted to hone the data being displayed
* Users can easily switch between node layouts as they would between windows
* Layouts *are* filters. When you switch from the trust radial layout to the harmonic grid layout, the trust layout dissolves in the background but the trust filter still shapes the data.
