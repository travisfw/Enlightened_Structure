The mission of Enlightened Structure Software Zero is to create a platform for swarm intelligence to
collaborate on a project, while retaining the edits and contributions of every author throughout the
history of the collaboration. Contributors do not have to agree on a single version; each author can
maintain their own latest version. This "branching" of creative works encourages a diversity of
perspectives that can be exchanged and interwoven in a creative network of any scale. Authors can
create unlimited branches, easily view differences between branches, and merge in changes from other
versions and authors.

The Software Zero launch rolls up the four main project areas of Enlightened Structure -- creative
collaboration, [trust and reputation systems](/Trust_Exchange), [visual navigation
of data](/Core_Network), and the [underlying data graph](/BaseParadigm) -- into one product release.
We're calling it the "Minimal Awesome Product". That is, it's the basic elements of each of the
Enlightened Structure project areas that make a great, usable, consumer-oriented web application to
get the ball rolling. This is just the beginning, but we want it to be a great beginning, with solid
tech and features that are useful for *you*.

Academic Applications
---------------------

A primary application of the Enlightened Structure technology is the Massively Parallel Academic
Research System (MPARCS). As Wikipedia has opened the encyclopedia by leveraging the “wisdom of
crowds”, so Enlightened Structure will open the cutting edges of human knowledge, as represented in
academic research. Research papers, or even seeds of papers, placed into the public domain with
appropriate supporting technology, will allow others to build on these works, while still preserving
intellectual ownership of ideas through total transparency and traceability.

Academic research builds upon other research. What if this could be done incrementally, as a living
conversation? What if instead of having to wait for a whole “new” idea, a paper could be improved on
incrementally, by anyone who had an improvement – minor or revolutionary? Then the world of research
and knowledge advancement could become truly alive, constantly morphing, reorganizing, improving the
human knowledge ecosystem.

The technology involved is an extension of the “wiki” concept popularized by Wikipedia. But instead
of trying to have a single, definitive version of each article, MPARCS allows each user to copy
other users’ articles, for editing, combining, remixing.

Reputation and Content Ratings
------------------------------

Ratings are an extremely important part of Enlightened Structure. Suppose an article on a physics
simulation algorithm spawns versions created by thousands of interested users. When the original
author wants to review the most interesting revisions, considering whether to incorporate any of the
new ideas into their own latest update, they can turn to peer ratings as a starting place, to locate
the most interesting content.

A sophisticated ratings system will allow ratings at several levels: from the entry level, where any
person can rate any article, up to the expert level, where articles deemed particularly
“interesting” by the open ratings community can be assessed by credentialed experts in a given
field. Users will also be able to rate other users, so that each user can create a personalized
ratings matrix, where the ratings given to articles by users they trust will be weighted more
significantly than those of users unknown to them.

New Models of IP Ownership
--------------------------

Enlightened Structure will leverage the same collective power as Wikipedia, while also allowing for
individual ownership – each user can copy and edit articles that are in the public domain, but the
original article will stay intact, allowing each contributor to receive full credit for their
contribution. The system will allow users to see the complete history of any article, tracing its
evolution through various authors, and providing a view of the differences between any given
versions.

Maximally Permissive Licensing
------------------------------

Enlightened Structure will be released as free, open source software, utilizing maximally permissive
licenses, allowing incorporation into free and commercial software without restriction. The
intention is to create a standard platform, with no barriers to use or incorporation into other
systems.

Architectural Foundations
-------------------------

Building simple, stable, long-term foundations for a new generation of information topologies All of
the technologies described rest on solid, distributed, ultra-scalable information foundations. Our
data layer and our foundations are made to be shared with a rich ecosystem of current and
forthcoming applications.

We Value
--------

* Openness
* Privacy
* Autonomy
* Distributability
* Content addressable storage
* Individual data ownership
* Local storage
* Meritocracy
* Freedom

Next Steps
----------

Enlightened Structure Software Zero is a work in progress. It continues to be developed as a
volunteer effort, supported by the team's belief in the power of this technology.
The features we have in the pipeline for our 2012 releases:

- Allow remixing of any page on any website (given appropriate licensing)
- Compare two versions of a page to easily to see changes and additions
- Merge all or part of the changes from another version into yours
- Rate authors and content, resulting in a rich network of trust information
- Visually discover trending and relevant remixes of content, based on popularity and trust metrics
